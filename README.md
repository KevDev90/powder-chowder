# Powder and Chowder

### Introduction to the Project
This is my "API Hack Capstone" Project for the Thinkful Software Engineering program. It was built out in about 2 weeks in December of 2020.
This project was built out using HTML/CSS, JQuery, the Fetch API, Yelp Api, Weatherbit API, and Leaflet.

### Project Summary
This project is an app that allows users to select a particular colorado ski resort on a map. After selecting a resort, that resorts weather data will be shown on the screen. The user can also then chose to show restauarants for that particular resort if they would like to visit that area!
